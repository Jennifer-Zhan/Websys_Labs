For JS:
We finished most part of the computation based on js. For displaying the swatch and creating slider, we largely use jquery to realize them.

For CSS:
Halloween is very close to the deadline of the lab, so we inspired to create a page with some "Halloween styles". For the background image, we choose a picture of a witch, 
and the main color choice of the page is Halloween orange, which could not only enrich the atmosphere, but also trick users have more fun to finish the hexed game.
In addition, when you are ready to start your game but not start it yet, one of the swatches would be a picture of halloween pumpkin, hoping the easter egg could help you to spend less time to finish the game.

What we did:

Jensen Chen: finish the stylesheet, and help to arrange the layout of the page

Jiahui Wu: Modify and test js file
