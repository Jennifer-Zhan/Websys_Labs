For this lab, we added all those functions, then we start to optimize them, add more number buttons and use CSS to make it nicer. We validate the html and css portion of the files at the end. We used a abstract class and an interface, and all the operation classes would extend the abstract class and implement the interface.

Creativity: It is close to enjoy the game Cyberpunk 2077, so our team number decided to create the calculator with cyberpunk style. We tried our best to improve the visual design of the page with the colors used in the web of the game.
To enhance the atmosphere of page, we also applied the concept image provided by the official as the bg image.
