For this lab, we added all those functions, then we start to optimize them, add more number buttons and use CSS to make it nicer.

What we did:

Jensen Chen: finish the stylesheet and improved the integrity of the page

Jonathan Yang: CSS and creativity

Jiahui Wu: Finish math part and do some form handling part
