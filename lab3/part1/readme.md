In this lab, our markup is semantically correct since we use validators to check our html and css. We use some
no-semantic elements such as div. The reason is we cannot find other tags instead of them while the markup is 
semantically correct. Sometimes we just want some tags that won't effect the format of contents, but other tags
such as section have some requirements, that's why we choose div. 

Jiahui Wu:hCard information I added to our personal resume page is useful to humans since they can use the email link 
to email me directly. And for machines, they don't know which is phone number and which is fax number if we just
give them the number, hCard can make machines get and clarify those information immediately.

The hCard information is very useful because it is very easy to read for both human and computer because of how it is formed . It could be stored as a HTML or a content file, the information is the same due to how it is formed.
