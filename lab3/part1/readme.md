In this lab, our markup is semantically correct since we use validators to check our html and css. 

We use some no-semantic elements such as div. The reason is we cannot find other tags instead of them while the markup is 
semantically correct. Sometimes we just want some tags that won't effect the format of contents, but other tags
such as section have some requirements, that's why we choose div. 

Jiahui Wu:hCard information I added to my personal resume page is useful to humans since they can use the email link 
to email me directly. And for machines, they don't know which is phone number and which is fax number if we just
give them the number, hCard can make machines get and clarify those information immediately.

The hCard information is very useful because it is very easy to read for both human and computer because of how it is formed . It could be stored as a HTML or a content file, the information is the same due to how it is formed.  

Shuhan Li: hCard is a format containing basic informations.People can read these information as an intergrated part. Also, the standard format and key words makes machine to catch specific information more quickly and easier. Web font is a function allowed by CSS, allowing the specified font file to be downloaded locally. This is a very efficient way because fonts are not limited to whether they are installed locally or not, and most browsers support Web fonts.

Jensen Chen: 1. I tried to mark up all information with meaningful semantically tag. For example, when the css classes decorate different information such as my telephone number, I would give a specific name for each class, which describe what the css classes decorate.
             2. Personally, I don't think that my html and css contain any non-semantic elements.
             3. With hCard, when people or machine don't actually view my finally html, they still could find information by searching the information under certain tags.

For the index and Jensen Chen resume page, the design and color use are inspired by the twitter.
