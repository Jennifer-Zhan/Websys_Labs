Part 2:
We just form the basic structure of HTML. We divide each song into a section so it will be easier to
modify it with css. And We divide different type of information(track name, genre,...) into different classes.
Our semantic is correct since We check every tag to make sure we end them at somewhere and there is no useless tag
in Our html.
