Part 3:
Logic for the markup:
We separated each song information into 10 sections and used <section></section> tag to represent them in better semantic meanings. Inside each section, there are an album cover image which is inside the <img> tag, and a <div> tag for all the information of that song. For better styling for each type of information, we give each information a class which represents its type. In this way, it would be convenient to change the style of one kind of information uniformly for different songs. In order for better styling, we also add the class even and odd for corresponding song sections with even number and odd number. Therefore, we could style the even sections of the song and odd sections of the song differently which is helpful for making a comfort playlist layout. The header of each column is in the <header> tag and the end entry is in the <footer> tag. Both tags could give a better semantic and underlying meaning of the document text.

Logic for styling:
We set the font-family for the body text and use google to import font information. For the font size, we set 1.2 em as standard, so the 20 percentage larger font and proportionally reduced font size is based on the standard font size we set which is 1.2em. We apply the different styling rules to each type of information of all the songs by using classes that we define in the html file as selectors. For listing genres with dashes, we use CSS Pseudo-element: before to add dashes. Since we add even and odd classes to even number song sections and odd number song sections. We could define different style rules for adjacent sections for better layout design. In order to make each column for one type of information, we used display: inline-block for all the h2 and paragraphs and we could also define the size of each pargraph block for well-formatted in this way. What's more, for some detailed design, we use hover change the color for the title ("Playlist-Ten Favorite Songs") and the album names(which is links) when the mouse moves over it.

The total design is inspired by Spotify, and there is the reference: https://developer.spotify.com/branding-guidelines/
