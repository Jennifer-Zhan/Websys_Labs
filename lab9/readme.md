idea for designing for interactive web page: the main purpose of the page is to input the stu's information and display the information we have saved, 
so we are aiming to design a web page with simplicity without losing beauty. We applied gentle color to avoid distracting users from checking their status, and used most simple form without any extra style to display the information,
to make sure that users could quickly locate the content they would like to find.

What we did:

Jonathan Yang: Helped to modify part1 and did half of part2

Jiahui Wu: Finished part1 and did some part2

Jensen Chen: Helped to finish the part3: finished the stylesheet

Shuhan Li: Helped to complete part2

Jennifer Zhan: Finished part3 and helped with stylesheet
